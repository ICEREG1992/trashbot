Wouldn't it be nice
To not have to care about anything or anyone?
It's not that I don't like you
And if it were I think that I'm just having trouble
Feeling successful in my own life
Maybe we could take some time to think
So I'll cut all my fingers off at the bone
'Cause its easier than trying to be okay
With the parts of me that I don't like
It's not as glamorous as you thought it'd be
It's not as easy as everyone made it seem
Why did it ever feel like a good idea to be alone?
So what's it gonna take
For these feelings to disappear?
What else can I do
To make my anxieties go away?
How else can I try
To get by without ending it all?
When there's nowhere you can run
I promise I'll still be the one
You can call when you can't sleep
And someday we'll look back and say
"why were we ever so afraid
To say how we feel?"
