I'm sick of trembling in fear at the idea of death
Since it's always on my mind i just hide in my bed
"everybody's scared of it" is what my therapist said
But my case seems worse, when i've barely been fed
Because the kitchen's too far to desire the steps
It'd take to make it down the stairs and try to find a baguette
Or something similar that wouldn't make my stomach upset
It doesn't feel like this is real, yeah, my mind is a mess
The only times it seems clear is when music is played
Some relatable creator says i'll soon be okay
Or when reading poetry trying to soothe the dismay
And i can lose my insecurities in cute little sayings, like
why frown when the sun goes down
If you'll wake in the morning to such nice sounds
When the nighttime creeps, well your eyes might weep
But that's just moonlight tryna find nice people
why frown when the sun comes 'round
Even if you feel shaken or upside down
When the daytime hits, you'll be great, my friend
Just make it through this, just make it through this
why frown when the sun comes 'round
Even if you feel shaken or upside down
When the daytime hits, you'll be great, my friend
Just make it through this, you can make it through this
